    <p style="text-align: left;"><em>This post has been nearly published since February. Click here for the <a title="Where have you been for the past 4 months!?" href="http://www.forthecloveofgarlic.com/?p=256" target="_blank">"Where have you been for the past 4 months!?" post.</a> </em></p>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-252 aligncenter" alt="Basket of groceries and calculator" src="assets/13549557823_67607a547b_o-300x200.jpg" width="300" height="200" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I thought a nutrition topic on budget eating would be a great first post in my newly unemployed status. So far, unemployment has been BUSY. How did I work 40 hours a week and still get stuff done?? Granted, much of my day consists of wedding planning (I just spent the last 2 hours researching how to make wooden benches) and filling out applications, which are not particularly strenuous activities, but then I cook, clean, work out, and BAM the day is over. I digress... Here are the strategies I use to keep our food budget in check!</p>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-251 alignright" alt="Chalkboard-Grocery-List" src="assets/Chalkboard-Grocery-List-300x263.jpg" width="300" height="263" /></p>
<p>1. <strong>Make a meal plan. </strong>This serves many budget friendly purposes. It allows you to figure out exactly what items you need to purchase without making extra trips to the grocery store later in the week. It also reduces food waste as you can determine what items you have in storage and use them in your next meal. You should also adjust your meal plan based on what is on sale each week, which is why you should...</p>
<p><strong>2. Do your research.</strong> Every week I would look online to see what was on sale for <em>multiple </em>stores. It is amazing to see the price fluctuations between each item! Using your meal plan, try to find the items you need which are on sale. Hamburger not on sale? Try ground turkey or switch your meal to something that is!</p>
<p><strong>3. Stock up. </strong>When items go on sale, and you use them frequently, stock up! It is amazing <a href="http://www.onegoodthingbyjillee.com/2012/10/31-things-you-can-freeze-to-save-time-and-money.html">how many things you can freez</a><a href="http://www.onegoodthingbyjillee.com/2012/10/31-things-you-can-freeze-to-save-time-and-money.html">e</a> and still not lose the quality. For example, this past week boneless chicken breasts were on sale for 1.88 per pound. I bought a family sized package and used freezer bags to store them in meal-sized portions. Now we have 5 meals worth of chicken, which should last us until chicken goes on sale again.</p>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-253 alignleft" alt="cost of food" src="assets/cost-of-food-155x300.jpg" width="155" height="300" /></p>
<p><strong>4. Change your perspective. </strong>Many people believe that vegetables are too expensive to purchase fresh. But think about this- to feed a family of four at McDonalds, let’s say they order 2 Big Macs, 1 cheese burger, 1 6-piece Chicken McNuggets, 2 medium fries, 2 small fries, 2 medium cokes and 2 small cokes. The total cost would be almost $28, with an average caloric intake of 900 per person. With that price I could currently purchase: 2 summer squashes/zucchini (~2lbs @ $1.29 per pound), a 15oz container of organic mixed greens ($4.99), 2 cucumbers ($1), 2 plum tomatoes ($1.50), and a rotisserie chicken ($5) to have a complete, nutritious meal for half the cost. Keep in mind, this is with a super large salad serving too.</p>
<p>And while the high caloric content of this McDonald's meal matters to me (I am a dietitian after all) you can still make a burger night meal, complete with the fries, for half the price.  I can currently buy 93% lean hamburger for about $3.99 per pound, an onion for less than $1, hamburger buns for $2, a large bag of store brand french fries for $3 and a liter of coke for $1. This total is less than half the price of the McDonalds meal, and is probably significantly healthier because you are buying leaner meat, not frying your food, and it isn't doused in salt to keep it edible for years on end. Is it the ideal meal for a dietitian? Obviously not. But if you are trying to save some money and still have a burger night, it certainly does the trick.</p>
<p><strong>5. Rethink the traditional meat, starch, veggie meal. </strong>Traditional meat, i.e. red meat, pork, chicken, and fish, is <em><strong></strong>expensive.</em> If you did not stock up on these items when they were "on sale" you will likely be paying a lot of money for your source of protein. Did you know that beans, nuts, and soy products can be significantly cheaper than traditional protein sources but still provide you all the necessary nutrition you need? While many American's believe they need "real" protein at a meal, there are actually some fantastic recipes which eliminate costly meats and still provide the protein you need! *Cough, cough... see <a title="Vegetarian Chili" href="http://www.forthecloveofgarlic.com/?p=194" target="_blank">here</a>, <a title="Meatless Monday Veggie Burgers" href="http://www.forthecloveofgarlic.com/?p=81" target="_blank">here</a> and <a title="Breakfast Bell Pepper Rings" href="http://www.forthecloveofgarlic.com/?p=126" target="_blank">here</a>.*</p>
<p>If you absolutely have to have meat at a meal, you can save considerable amounts of money by cutting back your portions of meat. A meat serving is only supposed to be 3 oz (a little less than 1/4 of a pound), yet we tend to fill half our plate with meat! By trimming your meat portion back to only 1/4 of your plate, and loading up on the inexpensive vegetables you can cut your meat budget in half.</p>
<p>Thanks for stopping in and I hope this was helpful for you! There is so much more to add to this list and I would love to know: what tips do you have to save money at the grocery store? Comment below!</p>

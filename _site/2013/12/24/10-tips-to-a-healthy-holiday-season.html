    <p>The word <em>healthy </em>is not typically synonymous with holiday eating. Growing up in an Italian family, Christmas season = food, and lots of it. From the seven fishes Christmas Eve, to all of the Italian Christmas cookies, we do a lot of eating. So how do I survive the holiday season? Through my <a href="http://www.forthecloveofgarlic.com/?p=62">nutrition philosophy</a> and these 10 tips and tricks!</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.forthecloveofgarlic.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/water.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-143 alignright" alt="Water" src="assets/water-200x300.jpg" width="200" height="300" /></a>10. Always have water handy. </strong>While I enjoy a glass of wine with my Christmas meal, having a glass of water always available will limit the amount of food and sugar-sweetened beverages consumed- thus reducing calories.</p>
<p><strong>9. Focus on family, not food. </strong>Avoid standing directly next to the buffet table filled with your favorite treats. Try to spend time away for the dinner table and socialize with family and friends. Even better- go outside and play with the kids or dogs. This not only gets you away from the table, but gives you a chance to exercise!</p>
<p><strong>8. <strong>Have a plan. </strong></strong>Does your family have a lot of appetizers before dinner? Are there vegetables served with dinner (and no, potatoes do not count...)? Is there a certain dessert you can't live without? Plan your feasting accordingly! Try to stick to the vegetable and fruit platter prior to dinner and make sure you include vegetables on your dinner plate. If your family doesn't typically serve a vegetable (like mine), make or bring one yourself! As for the dessert, don't deny yourself the pleasure of your favorite treat, just have a smaller slice!</p>
<p><strong>7. If you fall off your plan, don't give up. </strong>It's OK if you mess up around the holidays, but don't give up entirely!! Think of your plan as a meal by meal strategy, if you overeat during one meal, you have the next to make up for it!</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.forthecloveofgarlic.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/starches.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-145 alignleft" alt="Starches" src="assets/starches-300x225.jpg" width="300" height="225" /></a>6. Limit the amount of starch on your plate. </strong>Potatoes, corn, rolls, desserts- all of these are starches that can quickly increase the amount of calories you consume. Try to pick one of the items to enjoy and fill the rest of your plate with vegetables such as asparagus, green beans, or squash.</p>
<p><strong>5. Watch the extra toppings. </strong>Avoid adding "extras" such as butter, gravies, and creams. These typically add a LOT of extra fat calories, and thus extra pounds!</p>
<p><strong>4. Seconds of more vegetables are great! </strong>Vegetables are high in nutrients and fiber, and low in calories, making them the ideal second helping.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.forthecloveofgarlic.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/small-plates.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-144 alignright" alt="Small Plates" src="assets/small-plates-300x195.jpg" width="300" height="195" /></a>3. Use smaller plates. </strong>This is one of my favorite tricks. When you use a smaller plate, your brain thinks you are consuming more than you actually are because the plate looks so full. This also allows you to monitor your portion sizes without even realizing it!</p>
<p><strong>2. Follow MyPlate. </strong>Again, the dietitians best friend. Have 1/4 of your plate be protein, such as the ham or roast (make sure to trim that fat off!), 1/4 of your plate be starches, such as potatoes, rolls, or corn, and 1/2 of your plate vegetables.</p>
<p><strong>1. Enjoy the holiday. </strong>One day of poor eating habits will not cause you to gain 10 pounds, but several weeks of Christmas cookies and large meals will. Again, don't stress if you fall off your diet plan. Every meal, every day, is a new opportunity to eat healthy. Enjoy your family and have a wonderful holiday!!!</p>

<p>Welcome to forthecLOVEofGarlic! My name is Meagan and I am a Registered Dietitian living in Washington, DC. <img class="size-medium wp-image-31 alignright round" alt="Meagan" src="assets/PA314475_01-225x300.jpg" width="225" height="300" />Thanks for stopping by my newly-created blog!! On this site, you will find a variety of recipes and nutrition information that I hope will inspire you to make delicious and nutritious meals at home!</p>
<p>As a Dietitian I have a passion for food like no other. I was fortunate to have both sides of my family cook and pass that knowledge onto me from a young age. I literally grew up in my grandmother's restaurant, making the scrambled eggs for her Sunday buffet when I was 5 and learning the in's and out's of baking custards and pies when I was 10. My dad's side is a completely different blend of cook than my mom's: they are Italian (hence the garlic) and love to hunt and fish. As a result, I was also able to learn the ways of cooking a variety of fish, venison, moose, and even bear!</p>
<p>With knowledge of good tasting food in mind, I went on to become a Registered Dietitian. I received my BS from the University of Vermont, and continued my education at the National Institutes of Health in DC. I passed my RD exam August 2013 and continue to grow and love everything food related.</p>
<p>This blog would not be possible without my tech support/editor/photographer/partner-in-crime, oh-and fiancé (probably should mention that), Dan. We met our first day of college and immediately became best friends. Needless to say, by our sophomore year we were dating, and just this past October engaged!!</p>

<p>We are 4 days into the New Year, and right about now is the time where people begin to struggle. Yes, it does happen that quickly. In fact, 75% of those that make a resolution won't make it past the first month and it gets worse. The University of Scranton recently published a study which showed that only <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2980864">8% of people that make New Years Resolutions actually achieve them</a>. 8%! Considering nearly half the US population makes a resolution, that's a pretty large failure rate. So what does this all mean? Surviving past the first month is absolutely crucial to the long term success of whatever you are trying to achieve.</p>

<p><strong>#1 Make it realistic. </strong>Do your homework before starting a new goal. What is the likelihood that you will be able to achieve this goal? Think of it this way, if you start off with a smaller goal and make those necessary changes first, you can create more difficult goals later on. So, not only will you achieve your New Years goal, you'll achieve several more in the process!</p>
<p><strong>#2 Tell <em>everyone</em> about you resolution.</strong> I'm talking "the hills are alive," let-the-world-know kind of thing. Why? Because it holds you accountable! When Joe comes up to you at work and asks you how it's going, you don't want to disappoint. And almost as important...</p>
<p><strong>#3 Tell people your successes. </strong>Brag a little! You walked 4 times this week for more than a half hour? Awesome! You lost five pounds? Excellent! Eating a vegetable with every meal? Wooooo!! Telling people and celebrating your successes will make you want to continue the good vibe. But if you aren't doing as well as you'd like...</p>
<p><strong>#4 Don't give up. </strong>It makes me so sad when I see a patient doing well, have a bad day, then call themselves a failure because they missed a day. Then, they give up entirely, continue their previous habits, and lose all progress. DON'T GIVE UP!! We are human! You had X problem for longer than a month (most likely), so it will take much longer than that to break it. If you didn't meet your goal for the day or week, you have many <em>many </em>more days/weeks to achieve it!</p>

<p><strong>#5 Have an partner, or at least a confidant. </strong>By having someone with the same goals, you are statistically more likely to achieve them. It relies on principals 1-3 above. You are being accountable, able to celebrate your achievements, and have someone to push you through the rough spots. Don't have anyone with the same goal? Ask a family member, friend, even a random person you found on the internet for their support. They want to see you succeed as much as you do!</p>
<p><strong>Bonus: Don't stop at New Years. </strong>Bad habits form across the year, so why focus or wait until New Years to break it? You are living <em>now. </em>We often postpone starting goals until the 1st of the month (or, in this case, the 1st of the year), which just starts you off on a bad foot. If you see something you want to change, just do it! People often gorge themselves prior to starting a new weight loss regimen because they want to get everything they enjoy in right before it's "taken away." First of all, you are eating so many more calories that  you would usually eat, causing weight gain just before you try to lose it. Secondly, if you are taking anything away that you enjoy, you are lining yourself up for failure (at least in terms of the most common goal of the New Year, weight loss). Moderation is absolutely key to any success.</p>

<p>So, to practice what I preach, this year I am trying to take an exercise class 3 times a week. While I would prefer to go 4 or 5 times, I know that my life is too chaotic to take that much time off. By taking a class 3 times a week, it allows me to change schedules around if I'm planning on working out. Or, if something comes up where I can't workout, I'll have more opportunities later in the week to make up for it. Another resolution is to walk at least 10,000 steps a day. Dan got me a Fitbit for Christmas, which tracks my physical activity level and number of steps I take each day. I chose 10,000 after wearing it for a few days and averaging around 8,000 steps. Now, I've been getting out of my office every hour and a half to go on a 3-5 minute walk. I will admit, I missed the first several days goal by a few hundred steps, but I'm figuring out ways to increase my physical activity at work without it interfering with my duties, which is a pretty good accomplishment to start off the New Year!</p>
<p>What are your resolutions? What steps are you taking to make sure you keep them? Comment below!!</p>

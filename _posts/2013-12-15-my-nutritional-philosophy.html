<p>If there is a downside to being an RD it's this: everyone expects you to eat perfectly. When I go home for the holidays, I get a lot of "but you're a <em>dietitian</em><em>!" </em>when I reach for the desserts... and it drives me nuts!! Why? Well, it all goes back to the foundation of my nutritional philosophy. <strong>Moderation</strong>.</p>

<p>It sounds so simple doesn't it? Clearly, based on the fact that <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/overwt.htm">nearly 70% of our population is overweight or obese</a>, it isn't. And it's something even I struggle with during the holidays, or when any chocolate dessert is present. So, here is how moderation can be made easy: <strong>Make compromises. </strong>It is nice to think of each meal as a <a href="http://www.choosemyplate.gov/">MyPlate</a>. But we don't <del>always</del> eat this way. I like to think of the broader picture. If I don't have a vegetable for breakfast, I'll include some snap peas or carrots as a snack. No dairy for lunch? Why not add some non-fat yogurt in that sauce?</p>
<p>And as for dessert, which clearly is not on this plate, don't deny yourself a good treat, but again, adjust for it! Have a smaller slice, not the whole pie. Cut your calories earlier in the day by having a larger salad for lunch- filled with lots of fresh fruits and veggies and a nice <span style="text-decoration: underline;">fat-free</span> dressing.  And <em>enjoy</em> your treat! If you swallow it in 1 bite you are likely to want to go back for more. Take at least 10 bites before you swallow and really take in that flavor!</p>
<p>So, don't be shocked when a dessert recipe of mine calls for 2 sticks of butter. And please, don't yell at me for it. No one, despite what they tell you, is a perfect eater. And sometimes applesauce just cannot replace butter...I'm sorry. I will try to make  suggestions for great nutritious sides to serve with my carb loaded but oh-so-scrumptious entree, but I leave it to you to make <strong>compromises </strong>and practice <strong>moderation </strong>with what you eat!</p>

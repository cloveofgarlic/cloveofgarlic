<p>First of all, let me say, that there are <span style="text-decoration: underline;">many</span> variables when it comes to metabolism (how your body uses energy). This science is not as cut and dry as it is presented, which leads to people getting frustrated when they don't see the scale reflect their hard work. But there are a lot of people who use the "it must be my metabolism" card too often; relying on their metabolism for being the sole cause of their weight gain and dismiss their eating and physical activity entirely. I've used the word "balance" in almost all of my nutrition posts and the same concept applies here: balance is everything.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A calorie is your body's source of energy. It can come from either fat, protein, carbohydrate, or alcohol. When your body breaks down these fuel sources one of two things happen: your body uses the energy immediately as fuel or it is stored away. Some of this storage is short term, and some may be held for long term as fat.</p>
<p>Your "excess long term storage", is a balance of calories in versus calories out. Just 3,500 extra calories in = 1 pound of fat. So if you consume just 500 more calories than you burn in a day, your weight will increase by 1 pound in 1 week. If you burn 500 calories more than you take in, you would lose 1 pound per week. Many people pick either reducing calories in, or increasing calories out to lose weight. Dietitians and Physicians actually recommend that you do both. Here's why:</p>
<p>If you have a desk job and are very sedentary throughout the day, burning 1,500 calories, you would have to decrease your calories in to just 1,000 per day. This is such a small amount that it would be very difficult for you to get all of the other nutrients you would need to sustain life and you would likely be <strong>very</strong> hungry. Whereas if you decreased your calories to 1,400 per day, but increased you physical activity to burn 400 more calories per day, we would see the same amount of weight loss and you would likely feel a lot more comfortable.</p>
<p>There are numerous ways to estimate what your calorie needs are, but they aren't necessarily accurate. Generally, RDs recommend females consume 1,500kcal and males 1,800kcal per day. This, combined with 30 minutes of physical activity, 5 days per week, should result in weight loss.</p>

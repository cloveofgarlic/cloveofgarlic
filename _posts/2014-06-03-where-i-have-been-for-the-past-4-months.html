<p>Dearest reader,</p>
<p><em>I say reader because there has been 1 person who continues to check this blog everyday (Mom?), despite the fact that I have not posted in nearly 5 months. </em></p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_287" align="alignright" width="300"]<a href="http://www.forthecloveofgarlic.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/photo-3.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-287" alt="photo 3" src="assets/photo-3.jpg" width="300" height="225" /></a> New fancy living room furniture[/caption]</p>
<p>I am so very sorry for not posting. At all. <em>I can't write the word frequently because frequently implies that there is an occasional post... Damn. </em>You see, sweet reader, life really got crazy there for a bit. I became unemployed, took a trip back home, applied for what seemed like a bazillion jobs, interviewed for a bunch, got a couple of crappy offers, finally got an AMAZING offer, moved to an super spacious town-home <em>with numerous counter tops I can get messy</em>, went to Florida prior to starting said amazing job, got a massive stomach virus for 3/4 of the trip (<em>guess who threw-up on the Harry Potter ride !?!? Awww yeah). </em>I then tried to adjust my body's natural time cycle because commuting to the new amazing job sucks up several hours of my life per day (<em>Thank you, Capitol Beltway),</em> and finally had a mild scare when Dan's company lost some pretty significant funding and was threatening job cuts. Men, if you are reading, skip to the next paragraph. And if you are still reading this, I warned you... Life got so crazy that I even skipped my lady friend. Which has literally never happened to me and caused a bit of a panic attack. <em>Mom, if you are the sole survivor of my lack of posting...No, you will not be having grandchildren any time soon. And body, how is that supposed to make my life more relaxing? Seriously!</em></p>

<p>I guess one would say this has been a stressful time. But through all of the craziness that has been my life these past few months, I have emerged a better woman- who learned a lot about resilience, perseverance, and didn't have to take a super large pay-cut. <em>Seriously federal government, how can you pay people so much!? </em>I've also learned to appreciate Dan a lot more because he has been an absolute saint dealing with me. From the cooking, cleaning, and general sweetness, he has really been my rock in this job transition.  I am so so lucky to have him. <em>September 13, 2015!!!!</em><em><br />
</em></p>
<p><em></em>So reader, after several months of craziness, I think I am ready to blog again. I'm aiming low at once per week to start. But expect some incredible recipes to come your way! <em>Totally busting out my new paella pan this weekend, that thing is amazinnnggggg. </em></p>
<p>I hope my old readers will venture back, one day, but for now, thank you mystery reader. <em>Thank you. </em></p>
<p><em></em>With much love and appreciation,</p>
<p>Meagan</p>
